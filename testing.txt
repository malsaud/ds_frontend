Project: Density Spot

Responsible for usability and website/application testing

-Usability Testing:
     Created a user test for 3 random users on usertesting.com from the ages of 18-35
     - I wanted to limit the age range to a rough estimate of those that would most likely use our website (current Brown            undergrads and graduate students) and see how well they could navigate the website
     The test:
     Introduction
        Imagine that you are about to leave and find a place to sit down and get work done on a college campus. It's a busy           time of year and you want to check how busy certain places are.

     Tasks
        Launch URL: https://www.figma.com/proto/K5qIXV9IOwBxemryRhLbbKaK/Density-Spot?node-id=2%3A4&scaling=contain
        You have been taken to: https://www.figma.com/proto/K5qIXV9IOwBxemryRhLbbKaK/Density-Spot?node-                               id=2%3A4&scaling=contain. When you see the page, move on to the next step.
        Get access to the website (pretend that you've logged in with the right credentials) and click log in.
        Check how busy the Friedman Study Center in the Sciences library is.
        Navigate to the map and find the Sciences library.
     Questions
        How intuitive was it to navigate the site? Were the progress bars meaningful to you?
        What frustrated you most about this site? Is there anything that you wish this site had?
        What did you like about the site?
        How likely are you to recommend this site to a friend or colleague (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very Likely)?

      Of the three users we tested, all three found the interface simple enough to use and the navigation was intuitive. The         map was the most difficult to use, as is understandable since the functionality on that page has not been completed yet.       Users found the map difficult to read and use (actually find anything). 2/3 users noted that it would be nice to have         some kind of zoom functionality and one user helpfully noted that a search bar here would be useful. These are features       we would love to integrate, or at the very least, use a more intuitive/useable map.
      The progress bars made sense after reading the "About" page to see how the data was collected and interpreted to show         current results.
      All the users were pleased with its purpose and would recommend the app to a friend.
      
      Takeaway: Navigation and interface is intuitive and easy to use (except for the map). Use a different map or make             accessing the map much easier by adding a search bar/color-coding/zoom functionality. 

- Website Testing:
  Used the Selenium IDE to test a couple of simple interactions with the interface (as it is very basic and only a limited       amount of items to actually interact with).
  Tests:
  - Log in, filter results by location (north, south, east, west), search for CIT, Rock, Hay, and navigate to Map and About       pages (this encompasses all the functionality of the website)
    - Logging in failed, but this was either due a security issue (not being able to authenticate a Brown account) or not           being able to track Google authentication when running test
  - Interact with website already logged in
    - All steps passed

- Load testing
  Used BlazeMeter - a Chrome extension that has JMeter as its underlying
  software - to test our load ability

  Max Users - 1001VU
  Avg Throughput - 1.36Hits/s
  Errors - 6.4%
  Avg. Response Time - 686.66ms
  90% Response Time - 525ms
  Avg. Bandwidth - 1.4KiB/s

  Throughput seems very low, but might be flaw with testing software because
  tried it manually with a few friends accessing site, and it seemed to be
  functioning correctly

  Also realized that our website currently has a flaw that while we require
  a login at first, any user can access other page if given direct address correctly
  [easily fixed by changing to get requests as rendering files instead of directly
  loading html files]

 Responsible for testing accessibility, security, and compatibility.

 Since our project is up on localhost, I used chrome extensions to test accessibility
 and compatibility.

- Accessibility (WAVE extension):

    Test results:
        ERRORS:
            1) Document language missing:
                The language of the document is not identified.

            2) Missing form label:
                A form control does not have a corresponding label.

            3) Missing alternative text:
                Image alternative text is not present.
        ALERTS:
            1) Possible heading:
                Text appears to be a heading but is not a heading element.

            2) Skipped heading level:
                A heading level is skipped.

    Steps taken to fix errors:

        1) Added <html lang="en"> to every HTML document.
        2) Added the following in home.html and home.css:
            <label for="search" class="visuallyhidden">Search for a study spot!</label>

            .visuallyhidden {
              border: 0;
              clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
              height: 1px;
              margin: -1px;
              overflow: hidden;
              padding: 0;
              position: absolute;
              width: 1px;
            }

        3) Added alternative text to all images in maps.html

- Compatibility (Broswer Stack Chrome Extension):

    Tested Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Chrome on Windows and Mac.
    Also tested Android, iPad Air and iPhone 6s.

    Test results:
        Chrome and Firefox on Mac and Windows: No errors.
        Microsoft Edge on Windows:
            1) "Brown University" is in black, not white.
        Android:
            1) "Brown University" is in black, not white.
            2) Sign in button too small.
        iPhone 6S:
            1) Sign in button is grey, not blue.
            2) "Brown University" is in black, not white.
        iPad Air:
            1) Sign in button is grey, not blue.
            2) "Brown University" is in black, not white.

    Steps taken to fix errors:
        1) Changed all colors to websafe color values.
            Hex color #83b8d6 -> Websafe #99cccc
            RGB color (255, 255, 255) -> Websafe #ffffff
        2) Made sign in button bigger.

- Security (SecApps)

    - All GET requests were processed successfully.

    Testing Results (Vulnerabilities):
        1) Autocomplete enabled:
            An attacker able to access the browser cache can retrieve sensible
            information in cleartext.
            PROBLEM:
                <form id="login_form" action="/auth/google">
            SOLUTION:
                Added autocomplete="off"
                <form id="login_form" autocomplete="off" action="/auth/google">

        2) Error disclosure:
            The application/server could disclose error information within its source code.
            PROBLEM:
                http://localhost:8080/auth/google/redirect?code='%3E%3CTQbBH%3E# HTTP/1.1
            SOLUTION:
                This is OAuth-related (Google's API), and is taken care of in their source code.

        3) Cross-Script Included
            The application included external scripts. Must ensure they're trusted scripts.
            PROBLEM:
                http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js
                https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js
                https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js
            SOLUTION:
                All external scripts are in fact trusted scripts and were provided by the
                instructor and TAs.
                
  - Fixed HTML Security Issue (Detected by Janna): 
  
      1) Made all list items (navigation buttons in nav bar) redirect to paths instead of html documents. 
      2) Turned all html documents to ejs documents for the following reason: 
          -  ejs files are "rendered" from the server-side, not sent as html files (what we did before). 
             this makes it impossible for anyone to view the site simply because the path to the ejs file 
             does not exist on the server and will not be rendered onto the browser. the only thing an 
             unauthenticated user could possibly gain access to is source code (assuming they somehow know 
             the path to the web page).
